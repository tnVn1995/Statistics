## Abstract

$~~~~$Mind and body practices may be used to improve health and well-being or to help manage symptoms of health problems. The 2012 National Health Interview Survey collected information about Americans’ top 3 commonly used modalities and whether using each modality is because of the recommendation from any doctor, family member, or friend. There are statistical methods to study the association between two multiple response categorical variables, i.e. modality selection and recommendation in the survey. However, due to the way the questions were designed in the survey, no information was collected about failure recommendation. No existing efficient statistical methods can be directly applied to the scenario. In this study, we proposed a modified Pearson chi-square statistic to analyze the special data structure in the survey. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed method.

## Introduction

$~~~~$Often, in surveys, there are questions that ask respondents to "choose all that apply" from a set of items. Multiple categorical random variables are categorical variables that summarize these types of questions in a survey. Below is an example from [(Bilder-and-Loughin-2007)](#bilder-and-t.-loughin-2007)
![Farmer Survey](images/farmer_survey.png)

$~~~~$The survey was conducted by the department of Animal Sciences at Kansas State University. There were two questions in the survey about the sources of veterinary information and swine waste storage methods. Kansas farmers were allowed to select as many responses as there were from the list of items. For instance, 34 farmers selected professional consultant as a source of veterinary information and lagoon as  a waste storage method. A question of interest is whether the sources of veterinary information are independent of waste storage methods. Traditional Pearson chi-square test is not appropriate here because the multiple responses are likely dependent. Hence, An alternative test should be performed.

$~~~~$A simultaneous pairwise marginal independence (SPMI) test is performed to determine independence of each source of veterinary information and each waste storage methods. [(Bilder, C., & Loughin, T. 2004)](#ref2). Multiple procedures have been proposed to perform SPMI test. 

## Notation

Let W and Y denote the multiple-response categorical variables for an r x c table. Correspondingly, W and Y refer to waste storage methods and sources of veterinary information, respectively.
