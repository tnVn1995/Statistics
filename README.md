# Senior Thesis - Multiple Categorical Random Variable
## Mind and body practices may be used to improve health and well-being or to help manage symptoms of health problems. The 2012 National Health Interview Survey collected information about Americansâ€™ top 3 commonly used modalities and whether using each modality is because of the recommendation from any doctor, family member, or friend. There are statistical methods to study the association between two multiple response categorical variables, i.e. modality selection and recommendation in the survey. However, due to the way the questions were designed in the survey, no information was collected about failure recommendation. No existing efficient statistical methods can be directly applied to the scenario. In this poster, we proposed a modified Pearson chi-square statistic to analyze the special data structure in the survey. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed method.
